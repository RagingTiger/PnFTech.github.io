					used together with ranking, tuition, or admission rate data, directly
					shows not only the big picture of all the TOP 50 schools systematically, but
					also the relative application advantage and/or disadvantage of each school.</p>

					interests, will help you select objectively the best schools to apply.
					Meanwhile, suggestions on how to prepare your application are provided to
					leverage your advantages and improve your admission probability.
