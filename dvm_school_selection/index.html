	<p>We are excited to announce a new TEssay Analytics service: <b>DVM School Selection (DSS)</b>!</p>

	<p>As the name implies, this service is specifically designed for students who
    are applying for DVM programs in North America and Europe. With our custom
    DVM Application Score (DAS), this service offers a <i>rigorous</i> and <i>strategic</i> way
    to help you understand which programs are <u>objectively</u> the best choices for your application.
    By integrating up to 10 factors, the DAS is tailored to your profile
    and school interests. It directly and objectively shows not only the comprehensive
    picture of all the available programs, but also the relative <u>advantage and/or
    disadvantage</u> of each program. </p>


  <h3>How does the DSS service work?</h3>
  <p>DSS service is provided to you in the form of a report and personal consulting:</p>
  <ul class="posts">
      <li>Upon purchasing the DSS service, you will be asked to provide
        relevant personal information and school interests. </li>
      <li>After receiving your information, we will produce a report that
        contains schools we recommend and suggestions on how to
        prepare your application. Additionally, the report shows you how the
        schools are selected <u>quantitatively</u> by presenting the raw data (DAS,
        admissions, and programs), data visualization, and analysis of all the
        available schools. </li>
      <li>In the end, through the personal consulting, we will answer your
        questions and help you make the final decision on which schools to apply to.</li>
      <li>The whole service lasts 3 to 4 weeks.</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Price: 18,000 Yuan (or 2800 USD)</b></p>
