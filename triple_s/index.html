	<p>We are excited to announce a new family of TEssay services: <b>TEssay Analytics</b>!</p>

	<p>These new analytics services leverage the power of <i><u>Data Science</u></i>
    in <i><u>Python</u></i> and <i><u>college admissions data</u></i> to help
    customers develop the <b><i>objectively</i></b> best <u>college application
    strategy</u>: what schools to apply to, and what application factors to improve.</p>

  <p>For many people, college is one of the most important investments they will
    make in their life. This one decision, this investment can forever alter the
    course of your life. During the last 3 years at <b><i>TEssay</i></b> working
    diligently and passionately with our customers as they navigate the college
    admissions process, we found that the college admissions consulting industry
    is strongly lacking something crucial: a rigorous  application strategy. From
    our previous experience with and love of mathematics, data science, programming,
    and general computer science, we decided to create a family of services that
    will provide students with the evidence they need to make the objectively best
    decisions regarding their college admissions process.</p>

	<p>After several months of hard work, the first service of TEssay Analytics is
    here: <b>Undergraduate School Selection</b> (<i>aka USS</i>).</p>

	<p>As the name implies, with the USS service, based on our own custom
    <b><i>Application ROI</i></b> index, we can help you understand which schools
    are actually better investments (and in some cases which are relatively worse)
    for your college application.  This one index used together with ranking,
    tuition, or admission rate data, directly shows not only the big picture of
    all the schools systematically, but also the relative investment advantage
    and/or disadvantage of each school.</p>

  <h3>How does the USS service work?</h3>
  <p>USS service is provided to you in the form of a report. Upon purchasing
    the USS service, you will receive a report that contains the Application
    ROI and college admissions data, data visualization and analysis of the school
    tier you select. We divide the top 50 universities into 5 tiers based on ranking,
    and <u>each report contains the data analysis of one tier</u>:</p>
  <ul class="posts">
      <li>Tier 1 Report: Admission data analysis on schools with rankings from 1-10</li>
      <li>Tier 2 Report: Admission data analysis on schools with rankings from 11-20</li>
      <li>Tier 3 Report: Admission data analysis on schools with rankings from 21-30</li>
      <li>Tier 4 Report: Admission data analysis on schools with rankings from 31-40</li>
      <li>Tier 5 Report: Admission data analysis on schools with rankings from 41-50</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Price: 1077 Yuan (or 165 USD) per report</b></p>

  <p><i>Note:</i></p>
  <ol class="posts">
      <li>The rankings are based on 2020 Best National University Rankings by
        <a href="usnews.com">US News</a>.</li>
      <li>Since there are schools tied in rankings, every tier may contain more
        or less than 10 schools.</li>
      <li>College admissions data are from the fall 2020 entering class. They are
        the latest and most complete
        admission data. </li>
