		<h3>How it works:</h3>
		<p>1. <b>Choose</b> the essays you need us to write.</p>
		<p>2. <b>Sign</b> the contract and finish the payment.</p>
		<p>3. Tell us about your background.</p>
		<p><b>Answer</b> the questions in the survey so we know about your exciting
			background and experiences, education and career goals. The more we know,
			the better we can help you write the essay.</p>
		<p>4. Work with us on your essays.</p>
		<p>Once we receive the information you provide, we will begin to write the
			essay. It will be emailed to you when it is ready. It usually takes 5
			workdays.</p>
		<p><b>Review</b> and comment on parts you’d like to edit more, and email us
			the comments so we can edit it. The editing process usually requires
			less than three times.</p>


		<br>
		<br>

		<p>That’s it! In less than two weeks, you will have an application essay
			that shows your excellency and uniqueness.</p>
