	<p><b>1. Where do you get your data from?</b></p>
	<p>We harvest data from various public sources.</p>

	<p><b>2. How do you calculate your analytics?</b></p>
	<p>We have a small group of Data Scientists who do the necessary data munging,
    visualizing, machine learning, mathematics, software development, etc …</p>

	<p><b>3. Why should I purchase this service?</b></p>
	<p>Because you’re very clear about the value of <b>investing</b> in your
    academic career, and you want <b>every <i> advantage</i> possible</b> to help
    you successfully navigate the admissions process.</p>

	<p><b>4. What programming languages do you use for your analytics?</b></p>
	<p>We primarily use <b>Python</b> for all the <i>Data Science</i> work and
    <b>Docker</b> for any kind of deployment (i.e. training/deploying <b>machine learning</b>
    models, scientific computing with JupyterLab, etc …). </p>

	<p><b>5. How will this service help me?</b></p>
	<p>It will offer you a more <b>quantitative</b> and therefore <b>objective</b> picture of the
    different schools. By using  this service, you will be able to find schools
    with <i>higher application values</i>: <u>relatively high rankings,  high
    admission rates, and/or low tuitions</u>.</p>

	<p><b>6. Is the information in the report sufficient to help me decide which
    schools to apply to?</b></p>
	<p>It depends on what your needs and goals are. The report contains analytics
    on Application ROI, ranking, number of students applied and admitted, and
    tuition and required fees.  </p>

  <p><b>7. What guarantee do I have?</b></p>
  <p>We can only crunch the numbers. Ultimately what you do with it will determine
      how useful it can be.</p>

  <p><b>8. Can this report help me understand my probability of being admitted to
    a certain school?</b></p>
  <p>No. The Triple S service provides basic data analytics on college application
    values, which does not include the calculation of <b><i>personal admission probability.</i></b>
    However the next service we are currently  working on will provide this function.
    If you are interested, please check back with us later. </p>
