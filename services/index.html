		<h3>1. Choose the essays you need us to write.</h3>
		<h3>2. Signing a contract and place the payment.</h3>
		<h3>3. Tell us about your background.</h3>

			background and experiences, education and career goals. The more we know,
			the better we can help you write the essay.</p>
		<h3>4. Work with us on your essays.</h3>

			essay. It will be emailed to you when it is ready. It usually takes 5
			workdays.</p>
		<p><b>Review</b> and comment on parts you’d like to edit more, and email us
			the comments so we can edit them. The editing process usually requires
			less than three times.</p>
